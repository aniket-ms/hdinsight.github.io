### Resource groups
* Use a new resource group for each cluster so that you can distinguish between cluster resources

### Use NSGs, firewalls and internal gateway
* Use NSGs to lock down VNETs
* Use firewall to handle outbound access policies
* Use the internal gateway that is not open to the public internet
